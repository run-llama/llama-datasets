**FAQs**

When should I star a doc and when should I pin it?
--------------------------------------------------



Starring docs is best for docs of *personal* importance. Starred docs appear in your **My Shortcuts**, but they aren’t starred for anyone else in your workspace. For instance, you may want to star your personal to-do list doc or any docs you use on a daily basis.



[Pinning](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/2865511-starred-pinned-docs) is recommended when you want to flag or shortcut a doc for *everyone* in your workspace or folder. For instance, you likely want to pin your company wiki doc to your workspace. And you may want to pin your team task tracker doc to your team’s folder.



Can I star docs for everyone?
-----------------------------



Starring docs only applies to your own view and your own My Shortcuts. To pin docs (or templates) to your workspace or folder, [refer to this article](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/2865511-starred-pinned-docs).
