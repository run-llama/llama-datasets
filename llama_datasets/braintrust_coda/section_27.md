Can I edit an AI prompt retroactively?
--------------------------------------



You can retroactively edit your prompts for AI column and AI block, and you can iterate and add any prompts to AI chat. 


* To edit an AI block prompt, just right click on the block and select **Change prompt**.
* To edit an AI column prompt, right click on the column header and select **Edit AI**.
* For AI chat, just reopen the chat, then keep typing and submitting new prompts. Coda AI will iterate on its response.


It isn’t currently possible to retroactively edit a prompt for AI assistant. Once the assistant has generated the text or table, and you’ve hit the **Keep** button, you won’t be able to edit the prompt any further.



Can I reference tables, pages, columns, etc. in my AI prompt?
-------------------------------------------------------------



Absolutely! Whenever you want to reference a table or page, just type **@** into the prompt bar, then start typing the name of the table or page. Select the correct object from the dropdown list.



And with AI columns, remember that you can also reference other columns in the table using the same steps.



I’m not getting the results I want from my prompt - what should I do?
