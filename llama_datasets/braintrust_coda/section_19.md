**FAQs**
========


Can someone that’s not part of our organization share docs with our Google Groups?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Yes, however group members may / may not get notified based on the Google Groups setting. If your organization does not allow “anyone on the web” to post to a Google group, members of the group will not get email notifications when someone shares a doc with that group. Group members would need a link to the doc to access it.



Can I share docs with any Google group?
---------------------------------------



Sharing with Google groups is only available for Google Workspace users. We do not support sharing with personal Google groups (i.e groups with a .googlegroups.com extension). We also do not support sharing with nested groups.



How can I learn about other ways to share my doc?
