Coda AI is a work assistant, and a Coda building block. Coda AI uses instructions that you provide in a prompt box to generate or edit content. You can @ reference other pages, tables, or data within the same row as part of your instructions on what you’d like Coda AI to create, and it can refresh and generate more content as your doc gets updated.



Coda AI’s feature set includes the following:


* **AI assistant:** creates content on the page canvas of a Coda doc. The prompt instructions can @ reference content within another page or table to generate new paragraphs, checklists, tables with data, and more. It can also edit existing text on the canvas.
* **AI column:** creates content within a table via a prompt that can @ reference other data within the row.
* **AI block:** generates an AI-powered block on the page of your doc, that can summarize or find action items from data in tables or other pages.
* **AI chat:** brainstorm ideas, iterate on content, or get answers across your doc. It’s always available to collaborate, in your side panel.
