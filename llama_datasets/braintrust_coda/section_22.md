**AI assistant**
================


With the AI assistant feature, you can create text or tables, or edit text on the canvas. You can use this feature to generate content like blog posts, briefs, task checklists, poems, taglines, haikus, and more! You can also create tables with AI-populated data, such as 10 restaurants in Paris & their top dish, or suggested targeted audiences & their descriptions.
