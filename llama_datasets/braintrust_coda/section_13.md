**Convert to editable**
=======================


By default, all Compose columns start as formulaic columns - they are determined by the underlying instructions you’ve provided in the column settings. This means that you can’t manually edit a specific cell.



But if you want to make your Compose columns editable, you can simply convert the column back to a normal [canvas column](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/5979455-canvas-column-type). To do so, just right click on the column header, select **Column options**, then click the **Convert to editable** option towards the bottom of the dialog. Choosing this option will remove the Compose tab and store the current values in the column. The values are now editable in cell and will no longer update based on any previously referenced column values or formulas.
