So you want to move some - or all - of your data from Airtable to Coda. Luckily, we’ve built an importer that will allow you to do just that. With a few clicks, you can import your Airtable bases into Coda.




This feature is currently still in beta so may need some improvements. If you have any feedback to share, please [submit it here](https://coda.io/form/Airtable-Beta-Importer-Feedback_dZUNNwt8HtV). Thanks for helping make our product great!
