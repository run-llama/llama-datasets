**Request approval to install**
===============================


If your organization’s admin has enabled [Pack approvals](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/5574990-managing-packs-approvals-for-enterprise-admins) you won’t be able to install a Pack until they first approve it. To request approval to install a Pack:



* Click the **Request access** button in the Pack’s listing page.
* In the dialog, enter a message to accompany your request.  
Include any relevant details that would help the admin make a decision.
* Click the **Send request** to send the request.  
You can close the dialog.

Your organization’s admin will receive a notification, including who made the request. They may follow up with you for more information. When they make a decision, either to approve or deny, you will receive a notification with the decision. If approved, you will now be able to install the Pack as described in the previous section.
