One of the most powerful - and fun - components of Packs is the buttons they include. Most Packs give you access to special buttons that allow you to take Pack-specific action, from within tables or from the canvas of your doc. For instance, the [Slack Pack](https://coda.io/packs/slack-1000) includes a **Post Message** button, which can be used to send Slack messages directly from your Coda doc. Another example: the [Jira Pack](https://coda.io/packs/jira-1052) includes a **Create Issue** button to facilitate the creation of new Jira issues from a Coda table.
