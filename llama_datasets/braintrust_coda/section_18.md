**Access a doc that’s been shared with your Google Group**
==========================================================


To access a doc that is shared with a Google Group, members of the group need to provide their OAuth credentials so Coda can verify their group membership and grant access to the doc.



If you see the screen below when you are trying to open a doc that’s shared with a group you’re a member of, click on **Check Groups access** button and provide your OAuth credentials to open the doc.
