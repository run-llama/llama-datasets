**Invite specific Google Groups to your doc**
=============================================


If you use Google Groups, you can share docs with a large number of people by directly inviting the group email address to your doc.



To share docs with Google Groups, just click the **Share** button in the upper right corner of the doc. Then, in the text field, type the Google group email address that you’d like to share the doc with. Click on the **Invite Google Group email button** to provide your OAuth credentials. After that, decide what type of access the group should have and simply hit **Send**!

Once you’ve connected with Google Groups, go to any doc that you want to share and type the email address of the Google Group you'd like to share with. Then click on the **Invite Google Group email** button and hit send!



*If you’ve previously shared docs with Google Groups, please remove those email addresses and re-add them by clicking on the **Invite Google Group email** button.*  




**Note**: You or at least one member in your workspace must connect with Google Groups by providing your OAuth credentials to enable sharing with Google Groups. Once you or a workspace member provides their OAuth credentials, everyone in the workspace will be able to share docs with Google Groups.


Once you have shared your doc with a valid Google Group email address, you’ll also see all the Google groups you have access to in auto-complete the next time you share a doc.
