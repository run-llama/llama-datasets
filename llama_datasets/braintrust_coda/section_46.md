Get data from URLs
==================


While there are a few different types of column formats for Packs, one of the most powerful is the URL column. These columns allow you to paste URLs from the external tool directly into your Coda table and then see detailed, rich information from that URL.



For example, with the [Jira Issues](https://coda.io/packs/jira-1052) column type, you can paste the URL of a Jira Issue right into the column of your Coda table. And you’ll then see the URL automatically convert to an object that contains all of the information associated with that issue.



Once you’ve added one of these column formats, you can start pasting URLs into the column. Then you can choose to add any of those fields as columns. To do so, just hover over the object in the initial URL column. You should see a scrollable pop-up that displays all the data contained in that object. Next to each field, there is an **Add column** button. Just click that button, and the column will be added to your table. The information in that column is auto-populated based on the URL.
