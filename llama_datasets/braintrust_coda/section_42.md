**FAQs**
========


What happens to formulas, rollups, and grouping when importing into Coda?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Unfortunately Airtable does not provide any information on the specific formulas used in formula or rollup fields. There is also no information provided with regards to grouping. Coda supports formulas and grouping and these columns will just need to be updated post import.



What about my automations?
--------------------------



Automations are also not exported from Airtable’s API. Luckily Coda has Automations as well that can be quickly created by using the /automations command



Can I import Airtable interfaces?
---------------------------------



Airtable doesn’t provide a way to export interfaces, so we currently import them into Coda docs. Since Coda is an all-in-one doc, you can present information in any way you see fit. You can mix and match tables, views, and rich content, right in the Canvas. If you want to know more, a good place to start is our guide on [creating a visually impactful doc.](https://coda.io/resources/guides/how-to-design-a-doc-with-stunning-visuals)



How do Airtable concepts translate to Coda concepts?
----------------------------------------------------



Airtable has Workspaces, Bases, Tables and Views. Coda has similar concepts for these behaviors. A workspace in Coda holds a list of Coda docs. We translate Airtable Bases to a Coda doc. A Coda doc seamlessly combines the database capabilities of Airtable tables, views and much more in a flexible surface.



Interfaces in Airtable are replaced by Coda docs. Since a Coda doc is a flexible writing surface you can mix and match tables, views, and rich content in the Canvas.



Why is my Airtable import taking so long to complete?
-----------------------------------------------------



There is rate limiting on the Airtable API that limits the number of calls we can make per second. We can only pull 100 records at a time and thus it may take some time to complete an import that has many rows.
