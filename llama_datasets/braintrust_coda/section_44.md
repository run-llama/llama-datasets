One valuable feature of Packs is their custom column formats. These columns allow you to get rich information related to the specific integration, whether it be Spotify, Salesforce, or GMail. For instance, the [Google Calendar Pack](https://coda.io/packs/google-calendar-1003) includes the **Event** column format. This format allow you to paste a simple URLs of a GCal event into your Coda table. It then returns detailed information about the event - including date, start time, attendees, and so much more. You can even take those details and turn them into columns of their own. Read on to learn more about using Pack column formats.
