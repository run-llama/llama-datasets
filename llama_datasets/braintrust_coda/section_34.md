**Install a Pack**
==================


Packs are installed into individual docs, not across an entire account or workspace. This means you’ll have to install a Pack in each of the docs where you wish to use it. You must have edit access to a doc in order to install a Pack in it, and once installed anyone else with access to the doc can use the Pack you’ve installed.



From the Gallery
----------------


You can find and install published Packs in the Coda Gallery.



1. Open <https://coda.io/gallery>.
2. Click on the **Packs** menu item in the left panel to browse the Packs.  
Alternatively use the search box to search for the Pack you want.
3. Click on the Pack you want to install to open it’s listing page.
4. Click the **Add to doc** button to begin the installation.   
For Paid packs you haven’t yet purchased use the **Try it** button instead to begin a trial.
5. Search and pick an existing doc you want to install the Pack into, or click the **+ New doc** button to create a new doc.

The doc will be opened and the Pack will be installed. Note that if your Pack requires authentication you’ll have to [connect an account manually](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/2414841-authenticating-with-packs).



Private and internal Packs won’t be found in the gallery, but you can install them from the **Packs** page in your workspace.




From the within a doc
---------------------


You can install a Pack directly from within the doc you are working in by using the Insert panel.



1. Click the **Insert** button in the upper right of the doc.
2. In the side panel click on the **Packs** menu item.
3. Browse or search for the Pack you want to install.
4. Click on the Pack you want to install to open it’s listing page.
5. Click the **Add to doc** button to begin the installation. 


	1. *For Paid packs you haven’t yet purchased use the **Try it** button instead to begin a trial.*

If the Pack requires authentication you will be prompted to [connect an account](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/2414841-authenticating-with-packs) in order to complete the installation.
