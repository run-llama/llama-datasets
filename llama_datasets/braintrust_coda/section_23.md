**AI column**
=============


You can use AI column to generate content for one cell, multiple cells, or every cell in the column on a table. You can test your prompt in one or multiple cells before applying to every row in a column.


1. Press the **Add column** button (upper right corner of a table) to add a blank column.
2. Choose if you want AI to create content in one, multiple, or all cells in the column.


	1. To have AI generate content in just one cell, press the AI button in the desired cell to open up the prompt box.
	2. To have AI fill multiple cells, highlight the desired cells and then select the **Fill** button at the bottom of the table.
	3. To have AI populate all the cells in a column, choose the AI column type for the entire column.
3. Write a prompt with instructionsâ€”you can choose one of the options provided, or write your own. In the prompt, you can @ reference other data within the same row, or type = to open the formula builder.
4. Select your desired length, tone and type.
5. Select **Fill.**
