What access is granted to a Pack when I install it?
---------------------------------------------------


Installing a Pack doesn’t give it access to your account or the contents of your doc, but rather just makes it’s building blocks available to use. You can learn more about the Packs security model in the [Security of Packs on Coda](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/4587167-overview-of-pack-security).



How can I determine what Packs have already been installed?
-----------------------------------------------------------


The list of Packs already installed in the doc are displayed in the Packs panel. You can open it by clicking **Insert** (upper right corner of your doc), then **Packs**. You’ll then see an **Installed Packs** list.
