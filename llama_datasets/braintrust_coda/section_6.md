**FAQs**

Why are some docs now read-only after downgrading? What can I do about this?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------



When you downgrade, you’ll have a 14-day grace period to remove any paid features (locking, paid Packs, custom icons, etc.) before your docs become read-only. If you remove those paid features before the 14-day grace period, your docs will remain editable and you won’t experience any interruption. If you’ve passed the grace period without adjusting for those paid elements, your doc will be uneditable. In that case, you’ll need to contact support (through the **?** in the bottom right of your doc) for further assistance.



How can I delete a Coda workspace?

How do I delete my Coda account?
--------------------------------



Downgrading and cancelling only applies to workspaces - not to individual Coda accounts. If you’re looking to delete your Coda account entirely, [head over to this article](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/1948613-how-can-i-delete-my-account).



Who is affected when I downgrade my workspace?
----------------------------------------------



Downgrading applies to the entire workspace, not to your individual account. Therefore all workspaces members and all of their docs will be affected by downgrading.
