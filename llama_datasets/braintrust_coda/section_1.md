**Star your docs**
==================


To star a doc, hover over its name in the doc list and click the star icon. Alternatively, you can star a doc from within the doc itself. Hover over the doc title in the upper left corner, and click on the star.



Once you star a doc, you can access it quickly from the [My Shortcuts](https://coda.io/shortcuts) tab of your doc list.
