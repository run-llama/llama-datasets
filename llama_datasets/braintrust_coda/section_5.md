**Downgrade your Coda subscription**
====================================


*Note that you have to be a workspace admin in order to downgrade your Coda workspace.*



Canceling your Coda plan is synonymous with downgrading to the Free tier. To downgrade your Coda workspace, just follow these steps:


1. Go to your workspace home ([coda.io/workspaces](https://coda.io/workspaces))
2. From the options on the left, select the workspace you’d like to downgrade
3. Go to **Workspace settings**, then click into the **Billing** tab
4. Next to your plan type at the top, select **Change plan**
5. Find the plan you want to downgrade to, then click the **Downgrade** button beneath it. If you want to cancel your subscription entirely, choose the Free plan.
6. You’ll then see some warnings about what will happen when you downgrade. Depending on your situation, this may include docs becoming read-only. If you still want to proceed, click **Downgrade anyway.**
