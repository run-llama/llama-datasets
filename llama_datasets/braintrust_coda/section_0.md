Not all Coda docs are used in the same way. You'll inevitably have a few that you use every week, and some that you'll only use once. This is where starred docs can help you stay organized.



Starring docs is a great way to mark docs of personal importance. After you star a doc, it will live in a section on your doc list called **[My Shortcuts](https://coda.io/shortcuts)**. All starred docs, even from multiple different workspaces, will live in this section.



Starring docs only saves them to your personal My Shortcuts. It doesn’t affect the view for others in your workspace. If you’re wanting to shortcut docs not just for yourself but also for others in your team or workspace, you’ll [use pinning](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/2865511-starred-pinned-docs) instead.
