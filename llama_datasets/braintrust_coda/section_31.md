**Remove custom icons**
=======================


Makers can delete custom icons from the workspace library via the **Icons** section of their workspace.


1. From your doc, navigate to your workspace by clicking the Coda icon in the top left corner.
2. Underneath the name of your workspace on the left, select **Icons.**
3. Find the icon youâ€™d like to delete by searching or browsing.
4. Click the trash can icon to remove the icon from the workspace library. This will ensure no one can use this icon any longer within the workspace, but will not impact any docs or folders currently using the icon.
