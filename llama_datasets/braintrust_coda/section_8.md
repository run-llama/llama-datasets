Have you ever wanted to compose dynamic text that references values in each row? Maybe you want to send messages that contain dynamic text, such as status updates. This used to require using multiple formulas. Now you can do all that and more with the **Compose** feature.



With this feature, you can build templated [canvas columns](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/5979455-canvas-column-type) that reference column values and formulas with formatting. With the freeform editor you can reference columns (using @), format text (add bullets, bold and more) and formula results (accessed via =). The dynamic content can then be referenced by other columns, such as Gmail Pack button to send the content in an email.



Similar to formulas, values in the generated column are *not* editable directly and can only be changed via the Compose editor accessed through the column options dialog.
