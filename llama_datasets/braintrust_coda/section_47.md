**How often is data updated for these URL columns?**
----------------------------------------------------


This depends on the default refresh rate of the Pack. You can choose which refresh rate is best for in the Pack settings. To open these settings, click on the **Insert** tab in the upper right corner of your doc, then search the Pack name, click on the Pack, and then click into **Settings.** Here you’ll find the **Default refresh rate**. You can choose from **Manually**, **Daily**, or **Hourly** (note that some options are limited to [specific Coda plans](https://coda.io/pricing)).



How do I add a Pack button column?
----------------------------------


Great question! You can [check out this article](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/7897620-take-actions-with-pack-buttons) for all the info you need on Pack buttons.



**I pasted a link into a Pack column format, but nothing happened. What’s wrong?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There are a few things to check if this happens. First, check that your Pack is installed and your connection is working by clicking the Insert icon (upper right corner of the doc), then searching for the Pack you’re troubleshooting. More on [checking the connection of your Pack here](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/5622549-troubleshoot-packs-in-your-doc#h_22014a1a30http://help.coda.io/en/articles/5622549#h_22014a1a30).



Next, make sure the link you’re pasting actually corresponds to the format of the column. For example, the Spotify Pack offers three column formats: **Album**, **Track** and **Playlist**. The **Album** column will only work with links to *albums*, the **Track** column will only work with links to *tracks*, and so on. Links often contain a hint as to the format of their referenced data in the URL (e.g. the link *open.spotify.com/album/*[....](http://open.spotify.com/album/) refers to an album and should be pasted into a column of format **Album**).



How are these Pack URL columns different from Pack sync tables?
---------------------------------------------------------------


[Pack sync tables](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/3213629-using-packs-tables-to-sync-your-data-into-coda) automatically bring in sets of data from the 3rd party tool based on the filter criteria you set for the sync. Coda will search the available data and pull in any and all rows that match the criteria of your sync settings.



Pack URL columns, on the other hand, allow you to manually curate whichever pieces of data you want to include in your table.
