Add Pack columns
================


To add one of these columns to your table, youâ€™ll first need to make sure youâ€™ve [installed the Pack](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/7980712-install-packs) in your doc. Then, create a new column in your table by clicking the plus icon in the upper right corner of your table. From the column type options, search for the Pack name. You should then see a list of the possible columns for that Pack. Click on an option to add it to your table.
