**Remove a Pack**
=================


If you no longer wish to use a Pack you can remove it from your doc. Any of the Packâ€™s building blocks (formulas, actions, etc.) that are used within the doc will break once the Pack is removed. If you removed a Pack accidentally you can reinstall it to fix the errors.


To remove a Pack:



1. Click the **Insert** button in the upper right of the doc.
2. In the side panel click on the **Packs** menu item.
3. Click on the Pack you want to remove.
4. Click on the three-dots menu in the upper right of the Pack panel and then click on **Remove Pack from doc**.
5. In the dialog click the button **Remove this Pack**.
