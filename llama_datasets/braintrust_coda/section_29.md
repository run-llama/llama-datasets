Coda comes with a default set of icons, which can be used in doc titles, page titles, buttons, reactions, and more. But custom icons allow you to add even more personality to your doc - whether you want to get more professional or more whimsical.



Custom icons are available on all [paid plans](https://coda.io/pricing). All members of a workspace can use the icons that have been added to their workspace, in addition to Coda’s default set of icons. Custom icons can be uploaded only by the [Doc Makers](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/3388781-roles-in-coda-doc-makers-admins-and-editors#h_db9c340781) in a workspace.
