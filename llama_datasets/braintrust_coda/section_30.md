Add custom icons
================


Doc makers can add custom icons to their workspace from any icon picker in a doc, or from the **Icons** section of your [workspace](http://coda.io/workspaces).



In a doc:
---------


* Click on the icon next to your doc title to open the icon menu.
* Click **Custom**
* Click **Upload** and select a file. Square images under 5MB with transparent backgrounds work best. Images can be PNG, JPEG, or GIF format.
* Give your icon a memorable name. You’ll use this name to search for your icon in the future.
* Click **Confirm**

Everyone in the workspace can now use this icon to customize doc titles, page titles, callouts, and reactions.

-----------------------------


1. From your doc, navigate to your workspace by clicking the Coda icon in the top left corner.
2. Underneath the name of your workspace on the left, select **Icons.**
3. Click the **+New Icon**
4. Follow the prompts to select and upload a file from your device. Square images under 5MB with transparent backgrounds work best. Images can be PNG, JPEG, or GIF format.
5. Once you’ve uploaded the image, hit **Save**.

Now workspace members can start using those custom icons throughout docs.
