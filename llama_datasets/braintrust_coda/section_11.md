**Use formulas**
================


You can include more complex calculations by using = to bring up the formula editor. This can be useful when you want to perform function on a column per row such as calculating if a Launch date is overdue etc. To learn more about writing in Coda’s formula language, [check out this article](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/2695142-the-basics-of-coda-formulas).



By default, any formulas you enter here will reference the current row (think, [thisRow](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/3598277-what-is-thisrow-and-when-do-i-use-it)). If you want to reference other rows, tables, etc., you’ll need to reference them by their full name.
