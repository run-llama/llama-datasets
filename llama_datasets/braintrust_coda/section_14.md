How is a Compose column different from a normal canvas column?
--------------------------------------------------------------



[Canvas columns](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/5979455-canvas-column-type) allow you to put pages within the cells of a table. Each cell of a canvas column is directly editable and can be manually modified - without affecting any other cells in that column.



A Compose column, on the other hand, allows you to generate dynamic page content within the cells of a table. You predetermine what should be in each cell “behind the scenes” - so the contents for each cell are automatically calculated and created for each new row. Each cell of a Compose column is *not* manually editable. The contents of each sell and pre-determined based on the settings of the column.



Why can’t I delete the contents of a Compose column cell?
---------------------------------------------------------



This is because Compose columns aren’t manually editable. In other words, you can’t manually edit individual cells. Instead, you use the column settings to create dynamic content - then Coda auto-fills the cells based on that info.



If you want to make your Compose column manually editable, check out the [Convert to editable](http://help.coda.io/en/articles/8032777-build-dynamic-text-columns-with-compose#h_ad2955a94e) section above.



Can I put non-text objects in a compose column?
-----------------------------------------------



Compose columns primarily support text, dynamic text, and formatted text. You can also add images by either copy/paste, or by referencing an image column. Aside from that, you cannot add other Coda objects (buttons, tables, reactions, etc.) to Compose columns.
