**Tips & tricks for prompts**
=============================


When writing a prompt for Coda AI, keep this tips in mind:


* Make sure your objective is clear.
* Use relevant keywords to help the AI generate accurate responses.
* Give examples to clarify what you're looking for. If you want to guide the AI towards a certain context, include that information in your initial instruction, or @ reference the relevant table or page (or type = to open the formula builder).

* While Coda AI gives options for length, tone and type, you can also provide specific instructions, such as desired word count.
* Keep it simple - don't use overly complex language.
* Use formatting and punctuation to help the AI understand the structure.
* Try different prompts to get a variety of responses, or ask for a few versions of the same thing.
* Keep refining your prompts to improve the AI-generated content. You may need to test a few to get your desired outcome.
* Keep in mind that while AI tries its best to provide accurate information, it's always a good idea to fact-check important information, as AI can sometimes produce inaccuracies or outdated information.
* It's important to remember that the AI can have biases in its output, and it's possible to misuse generated content. Let's use AI responsibly.
* **Limitations:**


	+ Keep in mind that while AI tries its best to provide accurate information, it's always a good idea to fact-check important information, as AI can sometimes produce inaccuracies or outdated information.
	+ Although Coda AI can generate tables and format text like headers, bold, italics it can’t currently add certain Coda specific building blocks like callouts, Packs, formulas.
	+ The assistant only knows what you highlight on your page, reference in your prompt or any select list you’re using. It can’t search your web, docs or workspace for information.
	+ There are limits on how much text Coda AI can use as part of any prompt and its references. A rough guide is to try to keep your input to <10,000 words. We hope to increase this limit soon.
