**AI chat**
===========


With AI chat, you can get help with everything from editing content to asking specific questions about the content in your doc. It’s available at any time, in your doc’s side panel, and you can provide any ongoing instructions before deciding to insert the content in your doc.

1. Open the AI icon, in the bottom right (next to the ? icon).
2. Select one of the prompts, or write your own. Examples include:



	* Where can I find more information about what this team is working on?
	* What are the key milestones and dates?
	* What are the pros and cons with the suggested plan?
	* Write 5 suggestions of titles for this page.
	* Write a closing paragraph for this blog.
	* Create a table with next steps and action items.
3. Choose the context you want to provide: no context, the current page, or the current doc. You can also highlight text on the current page, and choose that selection as the context.
4. After Coda AI generates a response, you can add it to the current page (or open up a new one), by pressing **insert**.
5. You can also provide more instructions, and AI chat will generate more content.
6. When you’re done, close AI chat, and open it back up again whenever you want.
